    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Nico and I love to play soccer. I have played for many years and now have created this website that
        is all about it. In this website you will find tons of information on english soccer</p>
    <h2>English Soccer Pyramid</h2>
    <p>The Premier League is the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates
        on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August
        to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other, one home and one away. Most games are played
        on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.
        The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First
        Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League.
        However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League takes
        advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to
        broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively. This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to
        2029. The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025. The Premier League
        is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders. Clubs were apportioned
        central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL
        clubs.
        The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million
        homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018–19 season, the average Premier League
        match attendance was 38,181, second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated attendance across all
        matches was the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981, and most stadium occupancies are near
        capacity. As of 2023, the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances
        in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga. The English top-flight has
        produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English
        clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.
        Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and two from
        Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3),
        Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1). Manchester United have won the most titles, with
        thirteen, while Manchester City hold the distinction of having won the most successive titles, with four. Only
        six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and
        Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
